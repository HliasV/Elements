class Vec3:
    """
    A class representing a 3D vector.

    Attributes:
        x (np.ndarray): The x-component of the vector.
        y (np.ndarray): The y-component of the vector.
        z (np.ndarray): The z-component of the vector.

    The x,y,z attributes in the Vec3 class are arrays instead of a single value
    This allowa the Vec3 class to represent a collection of 3D vectors, not just a single 3D vector. 
    This can be useful in many contexts, such as graphics programming or physics simulations, 
    where you often need to work with large collections of vectors at once.
    By storing x, y, and z as arrays, each instance of Vec3 can represent multiple vectors. 
    For example, the x array could hold the x-coordinates of all vectors, the y array could hold the y-coordinates, 
    and the z array could hold the z-coordinates. 
    This design can make it easier to perform operations on all vectors at once, 
    leveraging the power of NumPy's array operations for efficient computation.
